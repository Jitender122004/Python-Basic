It's widely used in web development, data science, machine learning, automation, and more. Python's popularity comes from its versatility, large standard library, and strong community support. It offers many useful libraries like NumPy, Django, and TensorFlow. Python is cross-platform and used by major companies like Google and Netflix. Its beginner-friendly nature makes it ideal for both students and professionals.\n","\n","2) What is an interpreter in Python?\n","  -> An interpreter in Python is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line. It translates the high-level Python instructions into machine code that the computer can understand. Unlike compiled languages, where the entire code is translated at once, Python’s interpreter runs each line immediately, making it easier to test and debug. Popular Python interpreters include CPython, PyPy, and Jython.\n","\n","3) What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","  -> Pre-defined keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meanings and purposes in the language. They are used to define the syntax and structure of Python programs and cannot be used as variable names.\n","\n","Examples of Python keywords:\n","if, else, elif - used for decision-making\n","for, while -used for loops\n","def, return - for defining and returning from functions\n","class, try, except, import, True, False, None – and many more\n","\n","Python has 35+ keywords (as of Python 3.10), and you can view them by using this code:\n","python\n","import keyword\n","print(keyword.kwlist)\n","\n","4) Can keyword be used as variable names?\n","  ->No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python.\n","Keywords are reserved words that have special meaning in the language (like if, while, class, def, etc.). Using them as variable names will result in a syntax error.\n","Example:\n","python\n","if = 5  # ❌ This will cause a syntax error\n","If you try this, Python will give an error because if is a keyword used for conditional statements. Always use non-keyword names for variables.\n","\n","5) What is mutability in Python?\n","  -> Mutability refers to whether an object’s value can be changed after it is created.\n","Mutable objects: Can be modified after creation (e.g., change elements, add, remove).\n","Examples: list, dict, set\n","\n","Immutable objects: Cannot be changed after creation. Any modification creates a new object.\n","Examples: int, float, str, tuple\n","\n","Example:\n","python\n","# Mutable\n","a = [1, 2, 3]\n","a[0] = 100  # Allowed\n","\n","# Immutable\n","b = (1, 2, 3)\n","# b[0] = 100  # ❌ Error – tuples are immutable\n","Mutability affects how variables behave in memory and during function calls.\n","\n","6) Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","  ->Lists are mutable, meaning you can change, add, or remove elements after creation.\n","  Tuples are immutable, meaning once created, their elements cannot be changed.\n","  This design choice allows lists for dynamic data, and tuples for fixed or constant data that should not be altered.\n","\n","7) What is the difference between == and is operators in Python?\n"," -> == checks value equality (if two variables have the same value).\n","   is checks identity (if two variables point to the same object in memory).\n","\n","python\n","a = [1, 2]; b = [1, 2]\n","a == b  # True (values are same)\n","a is b  # False (different objects)\n","\n","8) What are logical operators in Python?\n","  ->Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:\n","\n"," and – True if both conditions are true\n","\n","or – True if at least one condition is true\n","\n","not – Reverses the result (True becomes False)\n","\n","9) What is type casting in Python?\n","  -> Type casting means converting one data type into another, such as:\n","\n","python\n","x = int(\"10\")  # Converts string \"10\" to integer 10\n","\n","10) What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","  -> Implicit casting: Python automatically converts types during operations\n","python\n","x = 5 + 2.0  # Result is 7.0 (int is converted to float)\n","Explicit casting: You manually convert types using functions like int(), str(), float()\n","\n","python\n","x = int(\"5\")  # Converts string to int\n","\n","11) What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","Conditional statements allow programs to make decisions based on conditions. They control which block of code gets executed (e.g., using if, elif, else).\n","\n","12) How does the elif statement work?\n","  -> elif (else if) lets you check multiple conditions after an if. It runs only if previous conditions are false.\n","\n","python\n","if x > 0:\n","    print(\"Positive\")\n","elif x == 0:\n","    print(\"Zero\")\n","else:\n","    print(\"Negative\")\n","13) What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","  ->for loop is used when you know how many times to loop (used with sequences).\n","\n","while loop is used when you don’t know how many times to loop; it runs as long as a condition is true.\n","\n","14) Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n"," -> A while loop is better when looping depends on a condition, not a fixed count.\n","Example: Asking for user input until they type \"exit\":\n","\n","python\n","while True:\n","    text = input(\"Enter text: \")\n","    if text == \"exit\":\n","        break\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"yvt7R8hfDjdJ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# practical Question"],"metadata":{"id":"HYuZLfheL6om"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["1) Write a Python program to print \"Hello, World!\n","\n"," -> 1.
